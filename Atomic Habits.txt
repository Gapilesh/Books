• For the first time when doing an action for a habit, dopamine will spike when receiving a reward.
• Next time the Dopamine rises before taking actions; immediately after a cue is recognised.
• The spike leads to a desire and a craving to take action whenever the cue is spotted.
• When a habit is learned, the dopamine will not rise when receiving the reward, because the reward is already expected.
• However, if we see a cue and expect a reward but the reward is not obtained, The Dopamine will drop in disappointment.
• But then if the reward is received late, the sensitivity of dopamine is felt and Brain says, 
  "See! I knew I was right! Don't forget to repeat the action next time"
• MOTIVATION is the anticipation of a reward; not the fulfilment of it, that gets us to take action.
• Can build good habits using this "Temptation Building" method. 
• That is, Connect the Habit you need to learn with the Habit you want to learn.
• Combine it with "Habit Stacking".
• That is, after doing a habit that you already do, do the new habit such as, "After I get my morning tea, I will say everything I am grateful for that happened yesterday."
   "Habit Stacking" + "Temptation Building"
   1. After [CURRETN HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED]
   2. After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT]
   => After morning tea, I will tell one thing I am grateful for that happened yesterday and then I will Play the LinkedIn Queens game.

• "With deliberate practice and development of a good habit, a child could become genius in any field" - Laszlo Polgar
• We don't choose our earliest habits, we imitate them from Friends and Family.
• We often follow the habits of our culture without even thinking about them.
• These social norms are the invisible rules that guide our everyday habits.
• Behaviours are attractive when they help us fit in. As humans, we all want to belong. So choosing the circle has a major impact on our behaviour on belonging.
• We imitate the habits of 3 groups, The close, The many, and The powerful.
• Imitating the Close
    1. Unconsciously we imitate some habits of the people closer to us.
    2. Friends and Family provide invisible peer pressure that pulls us in their direction.
    3. If you want to achieve something, surround yourself with the people with same mindset of achieving things.
    4. Join a culture where your desired behaviour is normal behaviour.
    5. Surround yourself with people who have the habits you want to have yourself, You'll rise together.
    6. "Nothing sustains motivation than BELONGING to the tribe"

• Imitating the Many
    1. In an experiment by Solomon Asch, 1950. When the group (of actors) intentionally choose a wrong option, The subject (an ordinary person) also chooses the same 
       option even though the correct answer is obviously visible. (They try to blend in).
    2. With the increase in the number of people choosing the same option, the subject also chooses to choose the same wrong answer.
    3. When its 1 actor and 1 subject. The subject chooses the correct answer because the choice of the actor doesn't affect the subject. But with an increased number of people, Yes the subject chooses the wrong option.
    4. Whenever we are unsure, we tend to act according to what the group is doing.
    5. The normal behaviour of a tribe often overpowers the desired behaviour of a person. 
    6. "The reward of being accepted is often greater than winning an argument, looking smart or finding truth".
    7. Most times we'd rather be wrong with the group than be right by ourselves.
    8. We can override it, by 
          ♦ Choose to ignore the Group.
          ♦ STOP CARING about what other people think.
    9. BUT, this takes Effort!
    10. If Changing habits = Challenging Tribe -> Unattractive
    11. If Changing habits = Fitting in with the Tribe -> Attractive
**Reflection**
• If you want to learn a Habit, Fit in with the group that has your desired habit as your normal habit.

• Imitating the Powerful
    1. As humans, we look for Power, Prestige and Status.
    2. We want to be acknowledged, recognised and Praised.
    3. A person with more Power and Status has to worry less about survival and potentially a more attractive mate.
    4. Behaviours that earn respect, approval, admiration and status are more attractive.
    5. Once we Fit in, We want to stand out from the crowd.
    6. So we care so much about the behaviours of highly effective people.
    7. We are also motivated to avoid behaviours that lower our status.

• In the book, "Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking", Helps to quit many people overcome smoking.
• Throughout the book, the author kept saying that smoking is not what smokers think it is, that it destroys them. Example,
    ♦ "You think you are quitting something, but you're not quitting anything because cigarettes do nothing to you"
    ♦ "You think smoking is something you need to do to be social, but it's not. You can be social without smoking at all"
    ♦ "You think smoking is about relieving stress, but it's not. Smoking does not relieve your nerves, it destroys them."
    ♦ "Get it clearly on your mind"
    ♦ "You are losing nothing and you are making marvellous gains, not only in health, energy and money but also in confidence, self-respect, freedom and 
        most important of all, in the length and quality of your future life".
• So throughout the book, the author of that book spitting out the fact of how the brain is not letting them move on, and telling the harm of smoking and 
  he firmly says the factual good points on why you should Quit smoking.
