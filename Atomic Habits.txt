• For the first time when doing an action for a habit, dopamine will spike when receiveing a reward.
• Next time the Dopamine rises before taking actions; immediately after a cue is recognised.
• The spike leads to a feeling of desire and a cracving to take action whenever the cue is spotted.
• When a habit is learned, the dopamine will not rise when receiveing the reward, because the reward is already expected.
• However, if we see a cue and expect a reward but the reward is not obtianed, The Dopamine will drop in disappointment.
• But then if the reward is received a late, the sensitivity of dopamine is felt and Brain says, 
  "See! I knew I was right! Don't forget to repeat the action next time"
• MOTIVATION is the anticipation of a reward; not the fulfilment of it, that gets us to take action.
• Can build good habits using this "Temptation Building" method. 
• That is, Connect the Habit you need to learn with the Habit you want to learn.
• Combine it with "Habit Stacking".
• That is, after doing a habit that you already do, do the new habit such as, "After I get my morning tea, I will say on ething I am grateful for that happened yesterday."
   "Habit Stacking" + "Temptation Building"
   1. After [CURRETN HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED]
   2. After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT]
   => Ater morning tea, I will tell one thing I am grateful for that happened yesterday and then I will Play LinkedIn Queens game.

• We often follow the habits of our culture without even thinking about them.
• These social norms are the invisible rules that guides our everyday habits.
