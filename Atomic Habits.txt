• For the first time when doing an action for a habit, dopamine will spike when receiveing a reward.
• Next time the Dopamine rises before taking actions; immediately after a cue is recognised.
• The spike leads to a feeling of desire and a cracving to take action whenever the cue is spotted.
• When a habit is learned, the dopamine will not rise when receiveing the reward, because the reward is already expected.
• However, if we see a cue and expect a reward but the reward is not obtianed, The Dopamine will drop in disappointment.
• But then if the reward is received a late, the sensitivity of dopamine is felt and Brain says, 
  "See! I knew I was right! Don't forget to repeat the action next time"
• MOTIVATION is the anticipation of a reward; not the fulfilment of it, that gets us to take action.
• Can build good habits using this "Temptation Building" method. 
• That is, Connect the Habit you need to learn with the Habit you want to learn.
• Combine it with "Habit Stacking".
• That is, after doing a habit that you already do, do the new habit such as, "After I get my morning tea, I will say on ething I am grateful for that happened yesterday."
   "Habit Stacking" + "Temptation Building"
   1. After [CURRETN HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED]
   2. After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT]
   => Ater morning tea, I will tell one thing I am grateful for that happened yesterday and then I will Play LinkedIn Queens game.

• "With deliberate practice and development of a good habit, a child could become genius in any field" - Laszlo Polgar
• We dont choose our earliest habits, we imitate them from Friends, and Family.
• We often follow the habits of our culture without even thinking about them.
• These social norms are the invisible rules that guides our everyday habits.
• Behaviours are attractive when they help us fit in. As humans we all wants to belong. So choosing the circle have a major impact on our behaviour on belonging.
• We imitate the habits of 3 groups, The close, The many, The powerful.
• Imitating the Close
    1. Unconciously we imitate some habits of the people closer to us.
    2. Friends and Family provide invisible peer pressure that pulls us in their direction.
    3. If you want to achieve something, surround yourself with the people with same mindset of achieving things.
    4. Join the culture where your desired behaviour is normal behaviour.
    5. Surround yourself with people who have the habits you want to have yourself, You'll rise together.
    6. "Nothing sustains motivation than BELONGING to the tribe"

• Imitating the Many
    1. In an experiment by Solomon Asch, 1950. When the group (of actors) intentionally choose a wrong option, The subject (an ordinary person) also chooses the same 
       option even though the correct answer is obviously visible. (The try to blend in).
    2. With the increase of the number of people choosing the same option, the subject also chooses to choose the same wrong answer.
    3. When its 1 actor and 1 subject. The subject chooses the correct answer, because the choice of the actor doesn't affect the subject. But with increased number of people, Yes the subject chooses wrong option.
    4. Whenever we are unsure, we tend to act according to what the group is doing.
    5. Normal behaviour of a tribe often overpowers the desired behaviour of a person. 
    6. "Reward of being accepted is often greater than winning an argument, looking smart or finding truth".
    7. Most times we'd rather be wrong with the group than be right by ourselves.
    8. We can override it, by 
          ♦ Choose to ignore the Group.
          ♦ STOP CARING about what other people think.
    9. BUT, this takes Effort!
    10. If Changing habits = Challenging Tribe -> Unattractive
    11. If Changing habits = Fitting in with the Tribe -> Attractive
**Reflection**
• If you want to learn a Habit, Fit in with the group that has your desired habit as your normal habit.
