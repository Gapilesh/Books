• For the first time when doing an action for a habit, dopamine will spike when receiving a reward.
• Next time the Dopamine rises before taking actions; immediately after a cue is recognised.
• The spike leads to a desire and a craving to take action whenever the cue is spotted.
• When a habit is learned, the dopamine will not rise when receiving the reward, because the reward is already expected.
• However, if we see a cue and expect a reward but the reward is not obtained, The Dopamine will drop in disappointment.
• But then if the reward is received late, the sensitivity of dopamine is felt and Brain says, 
  "See! I knew I was right! Don't forget to repeat the action next time"
• MOTIVATION is the anticipation of a reward; not the fulfilment of it, that gets us to take action.
• Can build good habits using this "Temptation Building" method. 
• That is, Connect the Habit you need to learn with the Habit you want to learn.
• Combine it with "Habit Stacking".
• That is, after doing a habit that you already do, do the new habit such as, "After I get my morning tea, I will say everything I am grateful for that happened yesterday."
   "Habit Stacking" + "Temptation Building"
   1. After [CURRETN HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED]
   2. After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT]
   => After morning tea, I will tell one thing I am grateful for that happened yesterday and then I will Play the LinkedIn Queens game.

• "With deliberate practice and development of a good habit, a child could become genius in any field" - Laszlo Polgar
• We don't choose our earliest habits, we imitate them from Friends and Family.
• We often follow the habits of our culture without even thinking about them.
• These social norms are the invisible rules that guide our everyday habits.
• Behaviours are attractive when they help us fit in. As humans, we all want to belong. So choosing the circle has a major impact on our behaviour on belonging.
• We imitate the habits of 3 groups, The close, The many, and The powerful.
• Imitating the Close
    1. Unconsciously we imitate some habits of the people closer to us.
    2. Friends and Family provide invisible peer pressure that pulls us in their direction.
    3. If you want to achieve something, surround yourself with the people with same mindset of achieving things.
    4. Join a culture where your desired behaviour is normal behaviour.
    5. Surround yourself with people who have the habits you want to have yourself, You'll rise together.
    6. "Nothing sustains motivation than BELONGING to the tribe"

• Imitating the Many
    1. In an experiment by Solomon Asch, 1950. When the group (of actors) intentionally choose a wrong option, The subject (an ordinary person) also chooses the same 
       option even though the correct answer is obviously visible. (They try to blend in).
    2. With the increase in the number of people choosing the same option, the subject also chooses to choose the same wrong answer.
    3. When it is 1 actor and 1 subject. The subject chooses the correct answer because the choice of the actor doesn't affect the subject. But with an increased number of people, Yes the subject chooses the wrong option.
    4. Whenever we are unsure, we tend to act according to what the group is doing.
    5. The normal behaviour of a tribe often overpowers the desired behaviour of a person. 
    6. "The reward of being accepted is often greater than winning an argument, looking smart or finding truth".
    7. Most times we'd rather be wrong with the group than be right by ourselves.
    8. We can override it, by 
          ♦ Choose to ignore the Group.
          ♦ STOP CARING about what other people think.
    9. BUT, this takes Effort!
    10. If Changing habits = Challenging Tribe -> Unattractive
    11. If Changing habits = Fitting in with the Tribe -> Attractive
**Reflection**
• If you want to learn a Habit, Fit in with the group that has your desired habit as your normal habit.

• Imitating the Powerful
    1. As humans, we look for Power, Prestige and Status.
    2. We want to be acknowledged, recognised and Praised.
    3. A person with more Power and Status has to worry less about survival and potentially a more attractive mate.
    4. Behaviours that earn respect, approval, admiration and status are more attractive.
    5. Once we Fit in, We want to stand out from the crowd.
    6. So we care so much about the behaviours of highly effective people.
    7. We are also motivated to avoid behaviours that lower our status.

• Chapter 10 - How to find and fix the causes of Bad Habits.
• In the book, "Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking", Helps to quit many people overcome smoking.
• Throughout the book, the author kept saying that smoking is not what smokers think it is, that it destroys them. Example,
    ♦ "You think you are quitting something, but you're not quitting anything because cigarettes do nothing to you"
    ♦ "You think smoking is something you need to do to be social, but it's not. You can be social without smoking at all"
    ♦ "You think smoking is about relieving stress, but it's not. Smoking does not relieve your nerves, it destroys them."
    ♦ "Get it clearly on your mind"
    ♦ "You are losing nothing and you are making marvellous gains, not only in health, energy and money but also in confidence, self-respect, freedom and 
        most important of all, in the length and quality of your future life".
• So throughout the book, the author of that book spitting out the fact of how the brain is not letting them move on, and telling the harm of smoking and 
  he firmly says the factual good points on why you should Quit smoking. 
• By the end of that book, The readers find that smoking is unattractive. By Changing your mind, you can quit smoking.
• This aligns with the 2nd Law of Behavioural Change, "Make it Unattractive".

• "Where Cravings Come From"
• Every Habit has a surface-level craving and a deeper, underlying motive.
• Every day, we make our best guess of how to act based on what we have seen and what has worked for us in the past.
• Craving is the sense that something is missing. It is the desire to change the internal state.
• Desire is the difference between where you are now and where you want to be in the future.
• "It is emotion that allows you to mark things as good, or bad, or indifferent" - Antonio Damasio (Neuroscientist)
• Whenever a habit successfully addresses a motive, you develop a craving to do it again.
• Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings.

• Reprogram your brain to enjoy Hard Habits.
• Shift the mindset to be optimistic. Example, 
    ♦ Instead of worrying you have to do "it", think about it as you get the chance to do it so 
      you develop a skill or knowledge which is good for you.
    ♦ Distraction is a good thing, because you need distraction to practice meditation and focus back.
    ♦ Instead of I am nervous, Reframe it as I am excited and I am getting an adrenaline rush to help me concentrate.
    ♦ When overthinking, think of  it as instead of looking for flaws in a person or an event, I can critically evaluate
      the good characteristics of that person/ opportunity.
    ♦ Mindset shift is a small thing, but it they can help change the feelings associated with a particular habit or a situation.
• Three Deep Breaths, and Smile before doing activities you enjoy. Eventually, Deep breathing 3 times and smiling 
  becomes associated with a Happy mood.
• The key to finding and fixing the cause of bad habits of yours is to reframe the associations you have about them.

• When you wait for perfection, You end up doing nothing.
• "The best is the enemy of the good".
• Planning itself doesn't give results. Action is required.
• More often, motion (Planning on doing something) do provide us with feeling like we are making progress without the running the risk of failure. Because, we dont want to get criticized or judged by others publicly. so we tend to avoid such situations.  
• Motion actually prepares you to get things done, only actions get things done.
• To master a habit, practice repetition.

• Habit formation: Behaviour becomes automatic over repetition.
• Long-term potentiation: strengthening the of connections between neurons in the brain based on recent patterns of activity.
• With each repetition, brain cell signalling improves and neural connection tightens. : Leads to clear physical changes in the brain.
• Hebb's Law: "Neurons that fire together wire together."
• Repetition is a form of change, Scientific evidence and common sense agree.
• Automaticity: The ability to perform a behaviour without thinking about each step, which occurs when the non-conscious mind takes over.
• Habits form based on frequency, not time. (according to the learning curve)

• The law of least effort.

14.01.2025
• Human behaviour is that we tend to do activities that require less energy than activities that require more.
• It is explained in Physics, Principle of Least Action.
• At first, we got an energy push to do 100 pushups but with days, it looked more energy-consuming so, we didn't continue.
• Energy is Precious and our brain is wired to conserve it.
• action that require More energy >> Less likely to happen.
• If we look at our habits, they are most likely to be done with less energy.
• It is crucial to make your habits easy so that you are more likely to do it even when you don't feel like doing it.
• The idea behind "make it easy" is not to "only do easy things". It is, to make it as easy as possible at the moment to do things that pay off in the long run.

• Trying to pump motivation with Hard habits is like, trying to force the water through a bent hose pipe.
• While making the habits simple and easy is like removing the bend in the hose.
